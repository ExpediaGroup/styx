Styx is a programmable reverse proxy for JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It can be used
as a stand-alone application, or as a platform to build custom networking applications. 
It is non-blocking, fully asynchronous and event driven therefore very scalable.

Styx Proxies HTTP requests to a configurable set of *Backend Services* typically a cluster 
of web servers (multiple origins) or load balancers (e.g. AWS ELB).

Requests are subjected to an *interceptor chain* (conceptualy a HTTP filter chain), which can 
respond or modify and pass through the request to the backend services. The interceptor
chain can be easily extended by *Plugins* written in Java.

Styx additional capabilities:
- Load balancing
- Origin health checking
- Retry mechanisms
- Connection pooling
- Admin dashboard (inspired and based on [Hystix Dashboard](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Dashboard))
- Performance and system metrics collection and reporting (Graphite compatible)

Most additional features can be *extended* via the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI) model.

The plugin and the SPI (Service Provider Interface) model enables developers
to build custom HTTP applications easily on top of Styx, which takes care
of common proxy server related functionality. Developers can then concentrate on
the value-add business logic.

### Use cases of Styx Plugins

* [Hotels.com](http://www.hotels.com) - Built authentication, UI rendering,
URL redirection and cookie cleaning plugins in front of backend services.

* [Expedia](http://www.expedia.com) - Built routing and bot detection capabilities on top of Styx. [More
info here](https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-eu/public/schedule/detail/61826).

* [Homeaway](http://www.homeaway.com) - Built various plugins.

## Dependencies

* [Oracle JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - It can be built with 1.8.0_45. 
  Earlier maintenance releases may, but are not guaranteed to work.
* [Apache Maven v3](http://maven.apache.org)
* Makefile (Optional)- There are fairly many ways of running Styx tests with different Maven profiles. Therefore, the 
  shortcuts for most common usages are compiled into a separate (GNU) Makefile for developer's convenience. To 
  take advantage of these shortcuts, a GNU Make build tool must be installed.
