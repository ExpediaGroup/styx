     * This method can be used to insert a new object, or to conditionally modify
     * a previously stored object.  This method takes two arguments: `key` and
     * `computation`.
     *
     * The `key` refers to the object name of interest. The `computation` provides
     * a new or modified object to be stored under `key`.

     * `computation` is stored in the database.
     *
     * The operation is considered a no-op when `computation` returns back the
     * already existing object instance. In this case the existing object remains
     * in the database, and watchers are not notified.
     *
     * When `computation` returns a different instance, the new object replaces
     * the existing version and the watchers will be notified. This is considered
     * a modification.

     * Note that the `computation` must always return a value. It cannot return
     * `null`, and therefore cannot be used to remove existing objects.
