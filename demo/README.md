# Styx Demo

This demo can be used to demonstrate the functionality of Styx, or to perform manual testing.

There are two components to this, the Demo Plugin and the Demo Origin.

The Demo Plugin can be used simply by starting Styx using the Makefile goal `make start-demo`, which will use the 
configuration defined at `distribution/conf/env-development/styx-config.yml`.

The DemoOrigin is run by executing the class directly (easiest from IDE).
