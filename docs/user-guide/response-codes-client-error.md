# Styx Client Error (4xx) Response Codes

When a client behaves in an unexpected way toward Styx, Styx will respond with specific error codes.
This refers only to responses generated by Styx itself, not responses being proxied from downstream.
For a general explanation of 4xx (Server Error) codes, please see the HTTP Spec.

Note that interceptor plugins can also be programmed to modify response codes, so 
they may introduce 4xx statuses for other reasons not listed here.


## 400 Bad Request

Occurs when a request is somehow incorrectly formatted. Examples:

* Unrecognised HTTP verb
* Multiple `Host` headers.


## 408 Request Timeout

Occurs if the channel from the client to Styx becomes idle, for example if the client starts sending a request
but does not complete it.
