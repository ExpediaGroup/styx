# Styx "Server Error" Response Codes

The purpose of this diagram is to explain why Styx might return a particular `5xx` code in an HTTP response.
This refers only to responses generated by Styx itself, not responses being proxied from downstream. For a general explanation of `5xx` (Server Error) codes, please see the [HTTP Spec](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
